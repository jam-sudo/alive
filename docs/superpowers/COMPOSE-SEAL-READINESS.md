## 목표

`COMPOSE-K562-v1` (ACTIVE)의 **pod sealed confirmatory run** — A100에서 유효한 `ActivationRecord`
(requirement별 non-empty evidence hash) + clean git tree로 seal을 **정확히 한 번** 연다.
실행 계약(runbook): `runbooks/2026-07-02-compose-k562-pod-sealed-run.md`.

## Critical path to seal

1. ~~C0 마무리~~ ✅ **done** (7/7 fixes, merged via C).
2. ~~C production driver fixture orchestration 구현~~ ✅ **done** — 단일 committed driver(`phase2a`/`preflight`/`phase2b --confirm-seal`/`recover`), synthetic fixture로 orchestration·fail-closed 전량 검증. Scientific ResolvedRunSpec/PREPARE carrier assembly는 ✅ 별도 구현·리뷰·main 병합 완료(C row); pod PREPARE 완성(real Norman evidence + B real worker)은 step 4에 남는다. *Gate PASS ≠ scientific verdict.*
3. ~~branch → main 병합~~ ✅ **done** (merge commit `1c46708`, 2026-07-09; whole-branch 리뷰 + Important 2건 fix; clean git tree 확보).
4. **development pod + PREPARE completion** — scientific ResolvedRunSpec/PREPARE carrier assembly는 ✅ 구현·리뷰·main 병합 완료(B 경계 fail-closed, seal 미개봉); 남은 것은 plan `plans/2026-07-09-compose-dev-pod-real-workers.md`에 따라 real workers + evidence를 완성하는 것이다. **GO resource identity는 해결됨:** v2 manifest가 Harvard Dataverse DOI/version/datafile roster/CC0-1.0/byte hashes를 고정한다. **pre-seal hardening + approximation-bias v1 LOCAL 코드는 ✅ 구현·리뷰·main 병합 완료**(merge `09065ee`, 2026-07-13): protocol-global scientific seal audit(`driver/seal_boundary.py`, §4.1 filesystem 강제), GI-secondary 정의 정정, 그리고 8-task #4 bias-metric(측정 스크립트 `compose_approximation_bias_report_v1` + one-way finalization tool `finalize_approximation_bias_config.py`(no report→config→report cycle) + verdict-invariant durable fairness carry(phase2b build-time, never ComposeSealedResult) + Phase-1-entry gate-decision record). 최종 opus whole-branch 리뷰가 2개 Important 통합버그(loader nesting·report-hash recipe, pod에서 seal 소각 잠재)를 잡아 수정+end-to-end round-trip 테스트 추가; full compose 1388 green; §4.3+config2+fit_role byte-불변; seal 미개봉. **남은 선행 gate(전부 POD):** GEARS/CPA published config·revision, conforming Probe A + reviewed output bridge, **real Norman에서 bias report 생성 + `sha256_file(report)`를 config에 finalize(real SHA→새 run identity)**, pod provider, fit-role-only smoke의 row-roster/zero-overlap/log/checkpoint 증거, package artifact hashes, immutable image digest. 현재 dependency lock은 runtime compatibility 관찰을 정직하게 `INCOMPLETE`로 기록하며 scientific guard가 이를 거부한다. §2.2 real `gears_worker`/`cpa_worker` + pinned env 구현·검증·commit; §4 activation-evidence를 **finalized active config로 real Norman data에서 재생성** + null requirement(config `power_status` · gears/cpa `environment_status`/`revision` · GEARS `approximation_bias_report_sha256`) 확립. Bias report는 final config SHA를 내장하지 않고 bias-null basis config SHA를 결속한 뒤 report SHA만 config에 단방향으로 채운다. ⚑ config 확정(null 채움 → 새 run identity) **후** evidence 재생성. real fit은 pod-only. *(현재 committed 분석 evidence는 pre-activation lineage이므로 §2.5 재생성 규칙이 적용된다.)* **2026-07-11 dev-pod probe**(`2026-07-11-compose-gears-decision-probe-results.md`)는 **QUARANTINED/NONCONFORMING**: 공식 one-time evaluation gateway는 소비되지 않았지만 Probe B prep가 dev role 확정 전에 전체 source `X`를 물질화하고 `U_full` 정규화 전에 gene subset을 만들었다. 따라서 기록된 Option 1 선호·`N_target≈2k`·coarse timing은 decision evidence가 아니다. 재실행은 `runbooks/2026-07-11-compose-gears-decision-probe-rerun.md`만 따른다. **GU**는 exact-committed-SHA(`7f6595f`) 3-lens 독립 리뷰 통과 → main 병합으로 **PASS**(seal 안 열림). 이후 pod-stage 순서: real candidate/GO/alias artifact → report mode(|M|) → exact candidate roster freeze → conforming Probe A → reviewed output bridge → Probe-B timing subcommand/반복 benchmark → owner 결정.
   **2026-07-14 hardening update:** 위 v1 병합 이력 이후 현재 계약은
   `compose_approximation_bias_report_v3`로 승격되었다. v3는 Probe-A admission/registration/verification
   provenance를 필수화하고, 모든 per-pair 파생 통계를 재계산하며, driver가 report를 한 번만
   읽은 immutable snapshot을 `run_phase2b`가 seal 전에 재검증한다. 따라서 pod에서 생성할
   신규 report와 ResolvedRunSpec은 v3 계약만 사용한다.
   **2026-07-19 Probe-A local production update:** commits `f62bd8c` and `589bc1b` implement the maintained
   `prepare/verify → build-probe-a-registration → probe-a → build-probe-a-report → build-evidence-manifest`
   write-once chain, canonical CSR float32 input boundary,
   separate preparation/GEARS lock identities with full installed-package-roster verification, actual clean-HEAD
   enforcement, and offline recomputation of matrix/row-role/sealed-overlap/reader-spy bindings. `589bc1b`
   additionally freezes the outcome-independent owner policy (`log_normalized_pseudobulk`, no second
   normalization, signed output preserved, exact determinism, `1e-5` numerical tolerances) and derives
   registration-v2's only run-specific scalar from the pinned prepared manifest. Local verification: full
   `tests/alive/compose` 1470 green, Ruff/format/diff clean. This satisfies the local implementation and owner-policy
   portions of conforming Probe A only. Pod measurement remains blocked until an independent exact-SHA review and
   the prepared-input-derived registration's external pin; it does not change `RELEASE-BLOCKED`, activate the
   scientific worker, validate the raw Jensen-floor metric, or open the seal.
   **2026-07-20 Probe-A graph/source correction:** the first conforming-pod attempt stopped before training or
   checkpoint publication when GEARS rejected `IER5L`; the failed evidence root is retained and is not eligible
   for promotion. Exact code commit `98bc2fe0a6e2dd65abc4f86e0ca4dfcf741bbb17` now makes `build-roster`
   independently compare the derived GO-node roster with the activation-pinned resource manifest and complete
   `gene2go_all.pkl` key set, requires that node artifact to remain inside the manifested evidence inventory, and
   freezes `perturbation_graph_policy=method_roster_intersect_gene2go` via upstream
   `PertData(..., default_pert_graph=False)`. This removes the unregistered legacy-essential symbol filter and
   aligns runtime composability with the existing canonical `var ∩ gene2go` contract. The independently
   follow-up commit `a568d0c` removes GEARS' implicit relative `./data/go_essential_<dataset>.csv` cache by
   computing in a private empty cwd with `make_GO(..., save=False)`; any relative cache artifact is fatal. This
   is a cache/provenance correction only and does not alter the GO similarity calculation.
   The independently
   pre-run-pinned offline-verifier source closure for this code is
   `23bff1ff50883dcbe034e88c297088452272cb9bb4228833c251d9d031c74756`; generator closure is
   `0f31e98a262901185efba973d9dcb27316e8ac86e6a8cd97c8933d025c35d536`. Owner policy bytes remain frozen at
   `bca70995117135367f3aadf77a551ba63b40fcbb426095611d0d63de7669a962`; the corrected run must derive a new
   registration bound to its final clean Git SHA and prepared manifest. Local verification: 79 core + 193
   focused/adjacent tests green; Ruff check/format and `git diff --check` clean. Seal remains unopened and the
   release state remains `RELEASE-BLOCKED` until the fresh pod evidence and offline verification pass.
   **2026-07-20 Probe-A direct-control correction:** a subsequent fresh-root attempt completed one 20-epoch fit
   and checkpoint, then stopped before raw publication because the instrumentation reused GEARS'
   `create_cell_graph_dataset_for_prediction`. That upstream helper always draws 300 controls with replacement,
   so it cannot supply the registered exact 1/8/300/301/400 prepared prefixes. The failed evidence root is retained
   and its command was not appended to the success-only ledger. The maintained direct path now uses the pinned
   helper's exposed single-cell constructor once per exact ordered prepared row, while public `predict` is left
   untouched. This preserves the preregistered test: public replacement-sampled output may legitimately fail the
   frozen first-prefix equivalence tolerance; neither owner policy nor observed values are changed. A new clean
   Git SHA, verifier-source pin, registration, and fresh evidence root are required before another fit.
   The correction is implementation commit `6a0d2776cc37da763b3c59c708c4c18af8b9e282`; its maintained Probe-A
   CLI SHA-256 is `692ad889fc019e295ee9178712ad4e970f3e3c5910035c8b86ee817d72f792ae`.
   The verifier closure is unchanged at the independently reviewed pre-run pin
   `23bff1ff50883dcbe034e88c297088452272cb9bb4228833c251d9d031c74756`; owner-policy bytes remain
   `bca70995117135367f3aadf77a551ba63b40fcbb426095611d0d63de7669a962`. The next registration must bind
   the final clean documentation commit containing this record, not the implementation commit alone.
   **2026-07-20 Probe-A repeated-fit correction:** the next fresh-root run completed fit 1, exact-prefix
   observation, and a 3.31 MB checkpoint, then stopped during fit 2 graph initialization before raw publication.
   The no-cache `make_GO` override had not been restored after fit 1, so fit 2 wrapped the override recursively
   and failed closed. The failed root remains quarantined and its `probe-a` command is absent from the success-only
   ledger. Commit `1a928b3fe63ff7c97d4c89c18c6fce2056f277fa` scopes the override to
   `model_initialize` and restores the exact original callable in `finally`; a same-process two-fit regression
   test now exercises this boundary. Worker SHA-256 is
   `716a70f3c86f1d0e51cbf46b54a1f73fd30d6cbb5bdcc67bc61b85a0918b2595`. Verifier and owner-policy pins remain
   unchanged. Another fresh root and registration bound to the final clean documentation commit are mandatory.
   **2026-07-20 Probe-A preregistered negative result:** the fresh run bound to clean commit `daff92d` completed
   both fits, published two byte-identical checkpoints, retained exact ordered per-control observations, and
   passed the zero-error determinism gate. It then mechanically rejected the frozen Option-1 bridge candidate:
   control-cap maximum absolute error `0.19060921669006348 > 1e-5`; public-vs-direct-first-300 bridge error
   `0.13841108322143558 > 1e-5`. Registration SHA is `771cbfd8…`, raw SHA is `ca9dbc16…`, and both checkpoint
   SHAs are `4b6c1e48…`. No tolerance, registration, public sampling, or transform was changed after observation.
   No canonical report/admission was published; the provider's immutable image digest was unavailable and was
   not guessed. Full identities, leakage checks, evidence-custody status, and disposition are recorded in
   `audits/2026-07-20-compose-probe-a-negative-result.md`. The scientific seal remains unopened. The
   `log_normalized_pseudobulk` exact-first-300 candidate is rejected; the named raw-pseudobulk comparator remains
   activation-blocked pending a separately reviewed representation/bias contract. Do not rerun this registration
   with altered parameters. The maintained local verifier now derives `pass|failed` from the three frozen gates,
   emits a hash-bound negative `verify.json`, and makes admission structurally absent on failure. This closes the
   negative-result software contract but does not retroactively complete the archived run or clear any activation
   blocker. That revision's now-retired verifier source-closure SHA-256 was
   `577c754dc72681aed8ad531ae3a3c2671a4c8cd11a1d941ee97ba44b5e4ff036`; it was never an operational image pin
   and must not be reused.
   **2026-07-20 Probe-A runtime-attestation hardening:** commit
   `d8e34bb10160e1825ed526097ce0cdbd141ab495` replaces ambiguous host CPU/RAM evidence with runtime-v3's
   separate provider-allocation, cgroup-effective, and host-visible views. It adds a write-once maintained
   `capture-runtime` command, rejects unlimited/malformed cgroup v1/v2 limits and allocation/GPU/image mismatch,
   and requires exactly one provider attestation plus its manifested raw control-plane source. Admission now
   requires the provider attestation SHA as an independent pre-run CLI pin; the verifier closure now includes the
   runtime producer driver and GEARS worker rather than only downstream validators. Focused/adjacent verification
   is 195 passing tests with Ruff check/format and `git diff --check` clean. The resulting candidate verifier
   source-closure SHA-256 is
   `54540ab4eb913a0fa82c4fb34ccdd2d8ddf27600fe309d990e6a31efa41eb760`; independent review is still mandatory
   before operational use. This hardening does not validate the archived negative run retroactively, authorize a
   new Probe-A registration, clear `RELEASE-BLOCKED`, or open the scientific seal.
   **2026-07-20 recursive-review correction (candidate, not operationally pinned):** the candidate implementation further
   upgrades runtime evidence to `compose_gears_probe_runtime_v4`; resolves cgroup CPU/memory from the current
   process leaf plus tighter ancestors; records a replayable network-namespace observation; rechecks loopback-only
   isolation plus captured cgroup/GPU identity before every stateful command commits its canonical ledger record;
   linearizes ledger append and manifest closure with a shared exclusive inode lock;
   independently binds the Probe-A CUDA determinism setting and `PYTHONHASHSEED` to the raw producer seed;
   validates recorded pod paths against their captured execution root without confusing them with the relocated
   offline-review path;
   rechecks the runtime-bound clean exact commit before and after every post-capture stateful command;
   binds preparation/verification commands, provider-assertion freshness, and the manifested `gene2go_all.pkl`
   bytes; and expands verifier closure
   to every `src/alive/**/*.py` decision dependency. Its pre-commit source-closure candidate is
   `4c36d77d07ea318e443503c5179f39de1dc95367a24aafa5cf5ecdbb7e848330`; the required local/adjacent contract
   roster passes 217 tests plus full Ruff check/format and `git diff --check`. The prior candidate pin is therefore
   retired for future runs. A clean implementation commit, full verification, recomputed pin, and independent acceptance
   are mandatory; this correction does not authorize a pod run or alter the archived negative result.
   **2026-07-23 managed-pod isolation correction (working tree, not operationally pinned):** a standard RunPod
   preflight proved that `unshare --net` is unavailable without `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`/`CAP_NET_ADMIN`; no scientific
   command or evidence publication was attempted and that pod was terminated. Runtime v5 therefore retains the
   lo-only namespace proof and adds an exact `no_new_privs` + seccomp alternative that permits only endpoint-free
   `AF_UNIX socketpair` IPC, denies all `socket`/`connect` plus `io_uring_setup`/`pidfd_getfd`, restricts execution
   to the validated x86_64 ABI and an exact allowlist for privilege-bearing capability sets, and actively
   re-probes IPv4/IPv6/Unix
   stream/datagram denial at capture and every stateful command boundary. The launcher now passes a same-PID
   sealed-memfd receipt whose canonical bytes are embedded in command-record v2 and replayed by the offline
   verifier. Receipt v2 also fail-closes non-`-I`/import-loader overrides, arbitrary wrappers or interpreters, and
   cross-command Python/driver drift. Its live memfd check establishes continuity inside the trusted producer; the
   archived self-checksummed JSON is explicitly not represented as independent remote attestation. The collector
   and expected-policy SHAs bind the committed request; they are deliberately not
   called a kernel-filter read-back because Linux exposes no such unprivileged introspection. Governing design:
   `specs/2026-07-23-compose-managed-pod-network-isolation-design.md`. All earlier verifier/image/owner-lock pins
   are historical after this code change; a clean commit, fresh signed verifier image/owner lock, and independent
   review remain mandatory. Seal state remains **UNOPENED** and execution remains **RELEASE-BLOCKED**.
   **2026-07-25 kernel-property verification (supersedes the "outstanding" status recorded above):** the single
   test that establishes the kernel property is `skipif`-ed off non-Linux hosts, so it had never executed anywhere
   — every green result this project had recorded came from a developer macOS host reporting `1 skipped`, and no
   CI ran the suite at all. `.github/workflows/test-suite.yml` (commit `614017b`) now runs the full suite on
   `ubuntu-24.04`, asserts the runner is a real x86_64 Linux kernel, and fails unless that test actually executed.
   Run `30154404171` succeeded on `Linux 6.17.0-1020-azure x86_64`: **2336 passed, 1 skipped** (the remaining skip
   is `test_features.py` `importorskip("torch")`), with the kernel-isolation test **executed and passed**. IPv4/
   IPv6 and Unix stream/datagram denial, x32 denial, `io_uring_setup`/`pidfd_getfd` denial, and same-PID sealed-
   memfd receipt validation are therefore kernel-proven. This establishes that the seccomp policy behaves as
   specified on x86_64 Linux; it does **not** establish that any production pod is correctly configured, which
   still requires that pod's own `capture-runtime` evidence. It does not clear `RELEASE-BLOCKED`, substitute for
   the exact-SHA independent review, or open the seal. The downloaded JUnit SHA, workflow SHA, run/kernel/test
   identity and original artifact archive digest are now preserved in
   `docs/activation-evidence/compose/kernel_isolation_ci_614017b67e35e9cc07f68d5b512213d8356cf1b2.json`
   as historical proof profile `x86_64_seccomp_primitives_v1`; the expiring GitHub artifact is no longer the only
   review record.
   **2026-07-25 launcher-wiring/durable-receipt correction (working tree, not operationally pinned):** the Linux
   gate now additionally requires a real maintained launcher → `execve` → driver self-check, pre-existing
   `connect` denial, non-Unix `socketpair` denial, and inherited-FD closure. CI profile
   `x86_64_seccomp_primitives_and_launcher_wiring_v2` fails unless both exact Linux tests pass and emits a
   canonical receipt that must be independently archived in version control. The historical v1 archive cannot
   satisfy this stronger gate. A clean exact commit, successful v2 Linux run, durable v2 archive, fresh verifier
   image/owner lock and independent acceptance remain mandatory.
   **2026-07-26 v2 launcher-wiring verification (closes the v2 run and archive items above; the rest stand):**
   run `30200634662` at commit `2dd23d627fc0e31a7d5005a3e81ff20b8dcd9472` succeeded on
   `Linux 6.17.0-1020-azure x86_64`: **2346 passed, 1 skipped** (the remaining skip is the same
   `test_features.py` `importorskip("torch")`). Both profile-required tests **executed and passed** —
   `test_linux_policy_and_sealed_receipt_validate_in_the_active_process` (0.068 s) and
   `test_linux_launcher_executes_driver_self_check_end_to_end` (1.434 s) — so the maintained launcher →
   `execve` → driver self-check path is kernel-proven, which the v1 one-test roster never covered. The
   canonical receipt and its GitHub artifact (id `8631825177`, expiring `2026-10-24T11:42:20Z`) are preserved
   durably as proof profile `x86_64_seccomp_primitives_and_launcher_wiring_v2` in
   `docs/activation-evidence/compose/kernel_isolation_ci_2dd23d627fc0e31a7d5005a3e81ff20b8dcd9472.json`.
   **Scope:** `alive.compose.network_isolation` is imported only by `gears_probe_a.py`, the
   `gears_decision_probe.py` driver, and the `run_network_isolated.py` launcher; the phase2b driver,
   `run_spec`, and the seal boundary do not use it. This evidence covers the GEARS Probe-A driver path, not
   COMPOSE scientific execution generally. **Review standing:** the archive was built by subagents dispatched
   from the session that authored the workflow and triggered the run, and the end-to-end test was introduced
   in this same commit, so this run is its first and only execution — this is *not* the independent
   third-party review the v1 archive recorded, and the archive's `archived_by` field says so. Three latent
   receipt-builder weaknesses were found and are **unexploited here**: `rerunFailure`-class tags are not
   treated as failures, a `failure` element nested below a non-`testcase` parent is not seen, and
   `--workflow` is validated by path suffix only. All three are forged-input paths, inert under the current
   lock (no rerun plugin installed), and are hardening items rather than defects in this run's evidence. This
   does **not** clear `RELEASE-BLOCKED`, substitute for the exact-SHA independent review, establish that any
   production pod is correctly configured, or open the seal. A fresh verifier image/owner lock and independent
   acceptance at a clean exact commit remain mandatory. Seal state remains **UNOPENED**.
   **2026-07-25 pre-pod local gate:** the probe-rerun runbook's §2.2 verification roster was run at clean exact
   commit `614017b67e35e9cc07f68d5b512213d8356cf1b2` — **254 passed**, plus `ruff check`/`ruff format --check`
   over the whole repository, `git diff --check`, and an empty `git status --short`. This records local
   implementation readiness only; the verifier OCI image, owner-frozen image lock, exact-SHA independent review,
   and pod-stage gates all remain outstanding.
   **2026-07-26 singular-design portability correction (branch `compose-singular-design-failure-path`, not
   operationally pinned):** `identify_operator` solved the normal equations with `np.linalg.solve` and let
   whatever LAPACK decided escape. For a rank-deficient design at `lam=0` the Gram matrix is singular, and
   whether LAPACK reports that or returns an arbitrary vector depends on rounding, hence on the CPU. Two Linux
   CI runners on the same commit disagreed: one reached the rank gate, the other aborted the development
   futility checkpoint with an uncaught `LinAlgError`; the macOS build never raises, which is why this was
   invisible locally. **The verdict was never wrong** — `failures` is built from the rank report, so a
   rank-deficient design stops for futility either way; what was not portable is whether the checkpoint
   *returns* that verdict or crashes first. The estimator now raises a typed `SingularDesignError` where LAPACK
   reports exact singularity, and selection scores such a candidate non-viable rather than letting it abort.
   The registered rank gate keeps its existing position: it is defined at the **selected** dimension and
   `FutilityResult` always carries selection outputs, so no complete result exists before selection and the
   gate cannot simply be moved ahead of it. The new branch is unreachable for an identifiable design, so a
   full-rank estimate is unchanged. **Residual, deliberately not addressed:** a build that does not report
   singularity still scores an arbitrary estimate, so `selected_lambda` for a rank-deficient design can still
   differ by platform; removing that means registering a numerical rank tolerance applied before the solve,
   which is a scientific decision, not a portability fix. This is a development-boundary correction with no
   config, lineage or evidence mutation. Seal state remains **UNOPENED**; execution remains **RELEASE-BLOCKED**.
   **2026-07-25 leakage-guard corrections (same branch, not operationally pinned):** two development-boundary
   guards were found failing open and were fixed with mutation-verified regression tests. (1) The measurability
   gate blacklisted `secondary_sealed`, a role name that exists nowhere else in the protocol; the real second
   sealed role is `sealed_single_unseen`, so the single-unseen regime passed a tripwire that was only ever
   checking a phantom. The gate is now an allowlist over the registered calibration role with a mandatory
   explicit role argument, and decision-bearing sealed-role references are now bound by semantic constants from
   one canonical roster rather than spelled out per call site or indexed positionally out of `ROLE_NAMES`.
   The config loader independently asserts exact parity with that roster. Role label values are
   unchanged, so no run identity moves. (2) Both recursive leakage scanners skipped numpy string/object arrays
   entirely; extending them to scan those arrays exposed a second fail-open, because the visited set is keyed on
   `id()` and the newly materialised temporaries let CPython recycle a freed address into a later temporary that
   was then skipped unscanned. Visited objects are now pinned for the walk. Neither guard is the primary seal —
   the outcome store's one-time claim covered both sealed roles throughout — but both are development-boundary
   walls that must not fail open. A clean commit and independent review at the exact SHA remain mandatory. Seal
   state remains **UNOPENED** and execution remains **RELEASE-BLOCKED**.
   **2026-07-20 upstream-custody/runtime-origin correction (candidate, not operationally pinned):** the next
   verifier revision archives the exact worker payload, fit-role H5AD, alias map, response projection, and selected
   roster as fixed manifest roles; derives `inputs.json`/role attestation from those bytes; and requires independent
   payload and selected-receipt pins. It binds the payload/approved-root/alias/roster paths across roster,
   preparation, verification, and measurement commands; rejects a truncated final JSONL record; includes all
   `src/alive` Python plus `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, the Python executable identity, and the complete active
   verifier environment's installed distribution file bytes (not selected version labels alone) in
   the verifier closure; and rejects `PYTHONPATH`, user-site loading, or an unexpected module origin before ALIVE
   decision imports; an operational CLI invocation also computes and compares that byte-level closure before
   importing any ALIVE or scientific dependency. Authenticated private snapshots close pathname replacement races for prepared H5AD,
   fit-role H5AD, and checkpoint reads. Schemas advance to evidence-manifest v8, inputs v4, role-attestation v3,
   roster-receipt v3, and positive/negative verification v2. The previous `4c36…` pin is retired. The recomputed
   candidate closure pin is `dbcb8053a4c4310860792336542751f20c6176349debc85c11be157614204876`; the complete
   local Compose suite passes 1539 tests with one pre-existing AnnData warning, plus clean Ruff check/format and
   `git diff --check`. A clean commit and independent exact-commit/pin acceptance remain mandatory; no pod or seal
   authorization follows from this local correction.
   **2026-07-20 verifier root-of-trust correction (local implementation; image not frozen):** independent review
   established that Python self-hashing starts too late to authenticate `.pth` startup hooks, stdlib, loader, and
   native libraries. The operational verifier is therefore moved to a single-platform digest-qualified OCI image,
   with owner-canonical image lock, digest-qualified build images, signed canonical Cosign approval subject,
   pinned Cosign executable and trusted root, no-network/read-only/non-root runtime, one evidence-only writable bind, and positive/negative
   receipt schemas v3 that bind the verifier image digest and external image-lock SHA. The previous `dbcb…` value
   is retained only as a historical diagnostic candidate. An isolated Linux image builder—not a scientific pod's
   own root filesystem—must still build, sign, independently verify, preload, and owner-freeze the real image and
   external lock pin. Until that occurs this is
   **RELEASE-BLOCKED** and authorizes neither a Probe-A rerun nor any seal opening. The governing design is
   `specs/2026-07-20-compose-probe-a-verifier-root-of-trust-design.md`.
   **2026-07-21 separated-builder correction (build gate executed; signing gate blocked):** the isolated image
   path is now a two-dispatch GitHub Actions gate. The first exact-SHA Buildx/GHCR workflow has no OIDC permission
   and emits only a canonical externally pinned unsigned candidate receipt. The second downloads that exact run's
   receipt by run ID, requires its external SHA, independently re-pulls the digest and recomputes labels/closure on
   a fresh runner, then signs a canonical subject under a distinct GitHub OIDC identity. It preserves exact Cosign
   and trusted-root bytes but deliberately does not create the owner image lock. Both workflows are present on
   `origin/main` at `6d8f141b047be7b4a4c4cb08429d088bbfb729c4`. Build run `29837916921` succeeded and
   emitted unsigned candidate receipt SHA-256
   `5de6310259a8ee58ce75541790dbd8e99a42c91ba1e9ba26a5f813934575d9ae`, image digest
   `sha256:8fc740a39895dbbec6378b7b3ce70f88914f13c55afd44b62a3b0f7a9cfec117`, and verifier closure
   `07c139b896aab2f79147fe060441df41e78f83737948dda55e3aef4e30ec15fa`. The signing dispatch was
   **not** run because the required independently protected `compose-verifier-signing` approval gate could not be
   established under the current private-repository environment capability. The replacement contract requires a
   dedicated offline owner Ed25519 signature over the complete canonical candidate identity before the OIDC step,
   plus an externally registered owner-key fingerprint and a v2 lock that binds all approval evidence. This contract
   is implemented locally. **2026-07-22 offline owner-key registration:** the owner-generated, comment-free public
   key is registered at `configs/compose_probe_a_verifier_owner_approval.pub`; its independently recomputed
   fingerprint is `SHA256:74j8HDNk+/psRVtv31L7wQGPmTKGd827dEoujQua5IU` and its canonical public-key-file SHA-256
   is `2d23c87d551aff2b77ab3ff87b5f208465921fde50af3d39939654848a5a5831`. The private key is not repository
   evidence and must remain owner-controlled outside the repository, pods, GitHub, and transcript artifacts. Before
   operational use, the repository fingerprint must match the separately retained owner record. Every earlier
   candidate remains unsigned/historical and there is still no owner image lock, candidate-bound owner signature,
   or accepted external verifier pin. Status remains **RELEASE-BLOCKED**; a registered key or unsigned digest alone
   is never seal authorization.
5. **§2.5 release gate** — worker locked-env integration green + 독립 검토 후 exact commit `C`를 마지막

6. **A100 sealed-run pod: runbook 실행** — 유효한 owner-approved external ResolvedRunSpec,
   `ActivationRecord`(requirement별 non-empty staged evidence), staged finalized config와 clean detached `C`
